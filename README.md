===========

Open Modular Rigging System for Maya, GPL 3 for non-commercial use.  

This code has been tested on Maya 2014.

This is the first release, and it is highly unfinished. It may eat your dog,
give your young nightmares, or turn the ViewCube back on every time you
disable it.  Use at your own risk.

The plan is to flesh out the base code with the missing bits, then start
adding more useful modules and a UI.
